	abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to automatically convert the German data model for documenting infrastructure inspections (ASB-ING) into a semantic ontology. Thus, an extensive data model is created that enables the representation of infrastructure and maintenance-related facts in Linked Data and is compatible with the German standards and guidelines. The national standard ”ASB-ING” contains about 120 classes and 500 attributes to describe a bridge or tunnel and its damages. It is the basis for the relational database program ”SIB-Bauwerke”, in which most bridges in Germany are recorded over the last 20 years. By converting the ASB-ING model into an Ontology, compatibility with this extensive available data set is ensured, enabling a direct translation of the existing asset data into Linked Data models. Concurrently, it is possible to relate the classes of this national data model with classes of other national or international ontologies. By mapping the ASB-ING Ontology to ifcOWL, the formerly only tabular data can be linked to standardised geometry models without requiring additionally developed geometric representation. Interlinking the ASB-ING Ontology with other international and national infrastructure data models can improve asset information exchange of cross-border projects.},
