	abstract = {This paper introduces the Relative Location Ontology (RELOC), which enables the expression of the spatial relationship between two entities using directional-topological terms. The ontology is designed to be compatible with the natural language-based approach of describing relative locations, enabling the conversion of existing location descriptions into structured spatial graph representations. The ontology provides directional, axis-related properties (e.g., longitudinal axis relations: front, center, rear) and topological properties (e.g., meet, contained in, intersect). These properties are finally merged into combined properties (e.g., containedInFront) to reflect the spatial information of statements like ’A is in the front part of B’. The application context of the RELOC Ontology is the processing of existing damage documentation of bridges. By converting existing textual bridge inspection datasets into structured spatial graphs, the ontology contributes to integrating legacy data into enhanced bridge management approaches.},
